## Applied Data Science Project - SpaceX
#INTRODUCTION
A comprehensive data science project is outlined herein, detailing each step aimed at predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. The objective revolves around forecasting the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX prominently features Falcon 9 rocket launches on its official website, boasting a price tag of 62 million dollars, notably lower than other providers whose costs soar to over 165 million dollars per launch. This substantial cost reduction primarily stems from SpaceX's ability to recycle the first stage. Hence, the ability to know the first stage's landing outcome holds significant implications for estimating launch costs. Such insights become invaluable, particularly if a competing company seeks to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch contract.

This capstone course offers a holistic view of the typical journey undertaken by data scientists when dealing with real life datasets. We will embody the role of a Data Scientist employed by a startup aspiring to rival SpaceX. Throughout the process, we will adhere to the Data Science methodology, which includes: data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and ultimately presenting findings to stakeholders. The primary task at hand is to predict the likelihood of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage achieving a successful landing.

#BUSINESS PROBLEM
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of our Data Science findings and models, the competing startup that hired us can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

#OBJECTIVE
~To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch.
~Explore the data in order to obtain more insight from the data.

#DELIVERABLES
~Accurate predictive algorithms
~Business case report to stakeholders
